My name is Matthieu Bulté and I'm a second year PhD student in Statistics at the Department of Mathematical Science at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

Here is my Twitter bio 
PhD student in stats @koebenhavns_uni || ex: data science @amazon, c++ dev @celonis & more || stats, math, programming || he/him

And here is the abstract to my first paper
Analyzing data consisting of density functions has received increasingly more interest in various fields of application. The non-linear and infinite-dimensional nature of such data has led to the development of a wide range of mathematical setups within which to analyze it. Approaches based on optimal transport have recently gained significant interest due to their theoretical properties and the geometry implied by the Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we consider the problem of regression in which the responses are density functions in a Wasserstein space with vector predictors. In this paper, we propose the Wasserstein Random Forest which combines the flexibility and performance of random forests with the theory of optimal transport to learn a solution to the non-parametric Frechet regression problem. Under regularity conditions on the regression function, we show consistency of the WRF. A numerical study consisting of both simulations and applications of our methodology to several datasets shows that our proposed method is competitive with existing approaches in terms of predictive power.

I need to create an academic website to present who I am and my work


Can you help me create a version in html and css







1. Help me create an academic website
2. Show me an template of an academic website in html and css
2. Can you show me an example of html for an academic website
3. My name is Matthieu Bulté and I'm a second year PhD student in Statistics at the Department of Mathematical Science at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.
4. Can you show me the html again for my website
5. But now please make it about matthieu bulté
6. I don't do Bayesian inference, but here is the abstract to my first paper

7. I would like the website to look more modern
8. Can we put the CSS in a separate file?
9. Can the content of the page be in a centered column
10. We can remove the publications section
11. I would like the section headers to be underlined when hovered
12. I would like the cursor to look like a link when hovering the section title
13. I would like the title of the page to be left aligned
14. I would like at the bottom of the page to have information on how to contact me and my social media links
15. Can we add a small logo for each social media
    // logos url were wrong
16. Actually remove the logos
17. How can make the contact section be at the bottom of the page, one line and grey

Can you show me the contact section in hmtl

This will make several lines

Can you make the text grey instead of the background

Can I make the links in the contact section look like text

I want a vertical bar to separate each link in the contact section

how can avoid having this property on the first element of the list
